        <p>With year-round sun and a dramatic combination of both the desert and beach, Dubai is the perfect setting to be swept away by high-adrenaline activities. Rocket across the Arabian Gulf in a speedboat or roar along the circuit in a race car, skydive over Palm Jumeirah, ski around The World, paddleboard along the coast or swim with dolphins and sharks, explore the depths of the open waters or go diving in the deepest pool in the world. You can even leave the city and dune bash in the desert or soar above the sand in a hot air balloon. Fasten your seatbelt, harness or helmet...itâ€™s going to be an exciting ride</p>
